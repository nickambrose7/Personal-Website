<Project 
  title="Better Texter" 
  description="Better Texter is an innovative iMessage application that enhances text communication using artificial intelligence. 
  It allows users to convert texts into various tones like professional, friendly, or humorous, and offers translation into nine languages. 
  A key feature is its smart voice texting, which lets users dictate messages, transforming them into well-structured texts with perfect grammar in any chosen tone. 
  Additionally, it offers personalization options through a companion app outside of iMessage. The app has recently gained popularity, surpassing 100 downloads on the App Store."

<Project 
  title="Workout API" 
  description="The Workout API is a RESTful service utilizing the FastAPI framework and a Postgres database hosted on Supabase. 
  It offers endpoints for user management, workout recommendations, logs, and goal setting. 
  A notable feature is its ability to predict weight loss based on workout logs and calculate a custom workout plan using basal metabolic rate and daily caloric deficit. 
  Working on this project, I gained experience using FastAPI, Alembic, Faker, and SQLAlchemy, and learned important lessons such as 
  the significance of thorough documentation, managing concurrent requests,
  and protecting against injection attacks."

<Project 
  title="Threading Library" 
  description="This library offers an API for C programs to create and manage threads, employing a round-robin scheduler to pick which thread gets to run next.
  Tackling the challenge of thread creation in C, especially with just one register swapping function, really tested my skills, but it essentially came down to 
  two key tasks. First off, we need some space for each thread's stack, so I used mmap to carve out a chunk of heap memory for this purpose. This step includes
  pushing a return address onto each thread's stack to prep them for launch. The second part involves switching between threads while keeping track of the previous
  thread's status. For this, I used a struct to store each thread's registers and stack pointer. Working on this project was an eye-opener, giving me a deep dive 
  into the mechanics of thread creation and operation. And let me be honest, debugging was an absolute nightmare!"

<Project 
  title="Divorce Prediction Machine Learning Model" 
  description="
  In a world where divorce rates are climbing, understanding the underlying factors is more crucial than ever. Our project ventures into the complex world of marital relationships, 
  utilizing Data Science techniques to predict the likelihood of divorce based on survey responses. We focused our study on a dataset from a survey among Romanian 
  couples, comprising 54 questions that capture various facets of a relationship, including communication, problem-solving, and compatibility. Our analysis includes 
  data preprocessing, correlation analysis, K-Means clustering, cross validation for feature selection, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) modeling, and sentiment analysis. 
  One of the most challenging
  aspects of this project was developing custom K-Means and KNN algorithms from scratch. This process, though daunting, proved to be a very rewarding 
  learning journey, offering deep insights into the mechanics of these algorithms and their application in understanding human relationships.

<Project 
  title="Screen Squad Movie Website" 
  description="Screen Squad is a dynamic website that transforms movie exploration, review sharing, and personal watchlist curation into an engaging experience. 
  Utilizing the TMDB API, it showcases a diverse range of movie details through a React-driven front end. The project features a comprehensive login system, and 
  offered me deep insights into essential web development aspects, from crafting aesthetically pleasing React interfaces to building a robust REST API with Node.js and Express. 
  Through this project, I gained experience in a wide range of software engineering subject areas like GitHub, sprint planning, continuous integration with 
  GitHub Actions, code reviews, test-driven development, and agile methodologies."

<Project 
  title="File Compression Tool" 
  description="The file compression tool is a command-line utility that compresses and decompresses files using Huffman Codes. My implementation achieves a 
  compression ratio of around 50% on average."
