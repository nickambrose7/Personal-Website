<Project 
  title="Better Texter" 
  description="Better Texter, an innovative iMessage application, enhances text communication using artificial intelligence. 
  It allows users to convert texts into various tones like professional, friendly, or humorous, and offers translation into nine languages. 
  A key feature is its smart voice texting, which lets users dictate messages, transforming them into well-structured texts with perfect grammar in any chosen tone. 
  Additionally, it offers personalization options through a companion app outside iMessage. The app has recently gained popularity, surpassing 100 downloads on the App Store."

<Project 
  title="Workout API" 
  description="The Workout API is a RESTful service utilizing the FastAPI framework and a Postgres database hosted on Supabase. 
  It offers endpoints for user management, workout recommendations, logs, and goal setting. 
  A notable feature is its ability to predict weight loss based on workout logs and calculate a custom workout plan using basal metabolic rate and daily caloric deficit. 
  Working on this project, I honed my skills in FastAPI, Alembic, Faker, and SQLAlchemy, and learned the significance of thorough documentation and managing concurrent requests."
