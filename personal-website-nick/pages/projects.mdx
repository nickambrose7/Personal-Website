<Project 
  title="Better Texter" 
  description="Better Texter is an innovative iMessage application that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance text communication. 
  It offers unique features like style translation, enabling users to switch their texts into various tones such as professional, friendly, or humorous. 
  Additionally, it supports translation into nine languages. Another standout feature is smart voice texting. 
  This feature enables users to speak their messages, which are then automatically transformed into well-structured texts with impeccable grammar in any desired tone
  Furthermore, users can personalize their texting experience through settings available in the Better 
  Texter companion app outside of iMessage."

<Project 
  title="Workout API" 
  description="Engineered a RESTful API using the FastAPI framework with a Postgres database hosted by Supabase. The Workout API provides enpoints for  user management,
   and workout-related features like recommendations, logs, and goals.  The Workout API is backed by a Postgres database hosted by Supabase. Thorough out this project, I
   learned many lessons such as the importance of documentation, how to manage concurrent requests. The API can generate the predicted weight loss for a user based on their
   past workout logs, and uses basal metabolic rate and daily energy expenditure to determine daily caloric deficit to produce generate a custom workout plan. In working on 
   this project, I gained experience in a variety of technologies including FastAPI, Alembic, Faker, SQLAlchemy. "
