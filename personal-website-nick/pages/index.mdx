## About Me

Hi, I'm Nick Ambrose, a Senior Computer Science major at Cal Poly, graduating in June 2024. 
I have a diverse set of technical skills, including software engineering, operating systems, and data science. 
My experience ranges from working as an IOS developer at Better Texter Inc. to being a Computer Science Tutor at Cal Poly. 
I've also worked on some cool projects like the Workout API and the Screen Squad movie website. 
Checkout my projects page for more info on those! 
I'm comfortable with languages like Python, JavaScript, and Swift, and I'm excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to the tech industry.
