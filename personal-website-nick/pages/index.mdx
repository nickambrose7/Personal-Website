## Nick Ambrose

Hey, I'm a Senior Compuer Science student at Cal Poly. I have a passion for learning and am looking for an industry position where I can make a really impact on the world.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

[**Deploy your own**](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
