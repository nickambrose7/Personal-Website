<Project 
  title="Workout API" 
  description="Engineered a RESTful API using the FastAPI framework with a Postgres database hosted by Supabase. The Workout API provides enpoints for  user management,
   and workout-related features like recommendations, logs, and goals.  The Workout API is backed by a Postgres database hosted by Supabase. Thorough out this project, I
   learned many lessons such as the importance of documentation, how to manage concurrent requests. The API can generate the predicted weight loss for a user based on their
   past workout logs, and uses basal metabolic rate and daily energy expenditure to determine daily caloric deficit to produce generate a custom workout plan. In working on 
   this project, I gained experience in a variety of technologies including FastAPI, Alembic, Faker, SQLAlchemy. "
